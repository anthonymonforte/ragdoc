# RagDoc

RagDoc is an open-source project designed to streamline the setup and hosting of a local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) server focused on processing documents. This project is initially aimed at handling PDFs, enabling users to ask questions about the content within these documents. RagDoc will be modular, facilitating the selection and integration of embedding APIs and the specification of document context to enhance processing accuracy.

## Features

- **Document Processing**: Process text and images within PDFs.
- **Modular Integration**: Easily select and integrate various embedding APIs.
- **Context Specification**: Define how documents are structured to improve processing effectiveness.
- **User-Friendly Setup**: Simplified setup for hosting a local RAG server.
